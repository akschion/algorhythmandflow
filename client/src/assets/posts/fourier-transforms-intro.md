# Introduction to Fourier Transforms

The Fourier transform is a fundamental tool in signal processing and analysis. It decomposes a function into the frequencies that make it up.

$$F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t}dt$$

## Applications in Signal Processing

Fourier transforms are widely used in signal processing for:

1. Frequency analysis of signals
2. Filtering unwanted frequencies
3. Feature extraction in pattern recognition
4. Audio compression algorithms

Code example:
```python
import numpy as np

def fourier_transform(signal):
    return np.fft.fft(signal)
```

The beauty of the Fourier transform lies in its ability to reveal hidden patterns in seemingly complex signals by breaking them down into simpler sinusoidal components.
