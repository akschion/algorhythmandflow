# The Mathematics of Hip-Hop Rhythms

Hip-hop music contains rich mathematical structures in its rhythmic patterns. This post explores the connection between mathematics and hip-hop beats.

## Polyrhythms and Time Signatures

Hip-hop often employs complex polyrhythms, where multiple rhythmic patterns occur simultaneously. Mathematically, we can represent these as:

$$\frac{a}{b} : \frac{c}{d}$$

Where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers defining the rhythmic relationship.

## Fibonacci Sequences in Beat Construction

Some producers unconsciously use Fibonacci-like patterns in their beat structures:

```
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

This creates a naturally pleasing progression that can be found in classic hip-hop tracks by producers like J Dilla and Madlib.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
function analyzeRhythm(beatPattern) {
  const intervals = [];
  let lastBeat = beatPattern[0];
  
  for (let i = 1; i < beatPattern.length; i++) {
    intervals.push(beatPattern[i] - lastBeat);
    lastBeat = beatPattern[i];
  }
  
  return intervals;
}
```

The mathematical analysis of hip-hop beats reveals the genius behind what might seem like simple music, showing how complex mathematical patterns create compelling rhythmic experiences.
