# Quantum Music Theory: A Mathematical Framework

Music and quantum mechanics share a surprising connection through mathematical structures. Let's explore how quantum mechanical principles can provide insights into musical harmony.

## The Mathematics of Musical States

In quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space. Similarly, we can represent musical notes as basis states:

$$
|C\rangle, |D\rangle, |E\rangle, |F\rangle, |G\rangle, |A\rangle, |B\rangle
$$

A chord can then be represented as a superposition of these states:

$$
|C_{maj}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|C\rangle + |E\rangle + |G\rangle)
$$

## Harmonic Progressions as Unitary Transformations

Chord progressions can be modeled as unitary transformations in this framework:

$$
U_{I-IV-V-I} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & e^{2\pi i/3} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & e^{4\pi i/3} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This mathematical framework provides new insights into why certain chord progressions sound pleasing to our ears!
