Okay, to the other AI working on the codebase, let's diagnose why URLs like www.algorhythmandflow.com/<something> are redirecting to the home page instead of loading the correct content.

Problem Summary:

The website is now loading static assets like the profile picture correctly on the custom domain www.algorhythmandflow.com. However, any URL path beyond the root, such as www.algorhythmandflow.com/about, www.algorhythmandflow.com/blog, or even non-existent paths, incorrectly redirects to the home page. This indicates a fundamental issue with client-side routing configuration, specifically how wouter is set up for a custom domain on GitHub Pages.

Likely Root Cause:

The most probable cause is still a misconfiguration of the wouter routing library, specifically related to the base prop in the <Switch> component.  Even though the initial issue with the incorrect getBaseUrl() function adding /algorhythmandflow has been resolved, the current setup is likely still not correctly configured for a custom domain where the website should be served from the root (/) of the domain.  It's highly likely that the <Switch> component is either misconfigured with an incorrect base or is not set up to correctly handle paths beyond the root in this environment.

Why it's redirecting to the homepage:

With an incorrect routing base or configuration, wouter is likely not intercepting the navigation to URLs like /about or /blog correctly.  Instead of rendering the appropriate component for these routes, it's falling back to the default route, which is the root path (/), hence the "redirect" to the homepage.  The 404.html page, while intended for page-not-found scenarios, might not be correctly interacting with wouter in this misconfigured routing setup, or is simply being bypassed altogether.

Steps to Diagnose and Fix:

    Verify <Switch> base Prop is REMOVED:

        Crucially, ensure that the base prop is COMPLETELY REMOVED from the <Switch> component in App.tsx.  Do not set it to / or any other value. For a custom domain, wouter should operate from the domain root by default, and any base prop is likely interfering.  Your App.tsx Router component should look like this:
        JavaScript

    function Router() {
        return (
            <Switch> {/*  NO base prop here */}
                <Route path="/" component={Home} />
                {/* ... other routes */}
            </Switch>
        );
    }

Ensure getBaseUrl() Returns '' in Production:

    Confirm that the getBaseUrl() function in utils.ts is correctly set to return an empty string ('') when in production (import.meta.env.PROD is true). This is essential for custom domains:
    TypeScript

    export function getBaseUrl(): string {
        return import.meta.env.PROD ? '' : ''; // MUST be empty string for custom domain
    }

Simplify App.tsx to Basic Routes for Testing:

    Use the simplified App.tsx code with basic HomePage, TestPage, and NotFoundPage components and routes (/, /test, 404) to isolate the routing problem. This will eliminate any interference from more complex page components or data fetching.  The simplified App.tsx code should look like this (as provided previously):
    JavaScript

    import { Switch, Route } from "wouter";

    // ... (HomePage, TestPage, NotFoundPage components - as previously defined)

    function Router() {
        console.log('Router component rendered'); // Debug log
        return (
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
                <Route path="/test" component={TestPage} />
                <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
            </Switch>
        );
    }

Thoroughly Test Basic Routes on Deployed Site:

    After deploying the simplified App.tsx, rigorously test these URLs on www.algorhythmandflow.com:
        www.algorhythmandflow.com/ (Homepage) - Verify "Homepage - Routing Test" renders.
        www.algorhythmandflow.com/test (Test Page) - Verify "Test Page - Routing Test" renders.
        www.algorhythmandflow.com/abc, www.algorhythmandflow.com/xyz, etc. (Invalid Paths) - Verify "404 - Not Found" renders.
        For each of these URLs, refresh the page in the browser to ensure refresh also works correctly without redirecting to the homepage.
        Check the browser's JavaScript console for the console.log messages added to Router, HomePage, TestPage, and NotFoundPage to confirm which components are rendering for each URL.

Examine 404.html (Revert to Simpler Version if Necessary):

    Ensure that the 404.html is the simpler version that only contains the basic redirect script to the root (/) using sessionStorage and location.replace(document.referrer || "/"). Remove any complex conditional logic or base path manipulations from 404.html.  The simpler 404.html code is:
    HTML

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Algorhythm and Flow</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="root"></div>
            <script>
                // Simple 404 redirect for SPA routing on GitHub Pages (History API)
                sessionStorage.redirect = location.pathname;
                location.replace(document.referrer || "/");
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>

Debugging Tools:

    Browser Developer Tools are essential:
        Console Tab: Use console.log statements in your components (especially Router, HomePage, TestPage, NotFoundPage) to track component rendering and the output of getBaseUrl().
        Network Tab: Monitor network requests for any unexpected redirects, 404 errors, or looping requests.
        Elements Tab: Inspect the DOM to confirm which React components are actually being rendered for different URLs and to verify the structure of your page.

By meticulously checking and simplifying the wouter routing configuration (especially the base prop), ensuring getBaseUrl() is correct for a custom domain, and thoroughly testing the basic routes, the other AI should be able to pinpoint and resolve the routing issue that's causing the redirect to the homepage for non-root URLs.  The key is to start with the simplest possible routing setup and incrementally add complexity back in once the basic routing is confirmed to be working correctly on the custom domain.
